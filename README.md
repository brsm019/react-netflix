The netflix look-a-like was written in React, utilising JavaScript, CSS and HTML in the form of JSX.

See the deployed version here: [Netflix Look-a-like](https://netflix-f849f.web.app/)

## Details

This is a frontend application that was used to test my knowledge of React, fetching from an API (TMDB) and also my CSS skills. For this project I used axios to create an instance and have all fetch requests in a file of their own for a separation of concerns. I then used React to display the information on the page and styled with CSS using flexbox.

## Built With

3. Run the application using the following command:

## Usage

Navigate through the page and check the UI. Future plans are to add functionality to the page as well as authentication and a payment sytem.
